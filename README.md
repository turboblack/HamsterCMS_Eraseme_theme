# HamsterCMS_Eraseme_theme

https://github.com/turboblack/HamsterCMS theme for HamsterCMS adapted for old browsers

![this is what theme looks like](https://github.com/turboblack/HamsterCMS_Eraseme_theme/blob/main/eraseme.png)

To use a template, create an **Eraseme** folder in the **templates** folder, paste theme file there, open the admin panel on the hosting, select the page, and specify this template in the options.

I invite you to visit the hosting that runs on this CMS
